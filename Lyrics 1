Opening the eyes,
Right Into the abyss,
Changing to a light,
Escaping to gravity,

Through the circles and spheres,
Reaching a new dimension,
From one to other lightyear,
Through the cyclic attraction,

A wave(ray ?) of energy,
A simple frequency,
Drown into the light,
Of a dying nebula

Reaching a new step
Floating into time
